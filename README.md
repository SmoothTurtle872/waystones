# Waystones Datapack
## What is it?
The waystones datapack is a simple way to add waystones to a vannila minecarft world through lodestones.
### Getting started
to start you will need to craft the linking compass:

with this recipie:

Then you simpily rightclick on a lodestoen with the linking compass to teleport!  

### Notes
- This works accross dimensions, even modded ones and ones added by other datapacks
- Currently there is no cost to using the compass
- The previous version of the pack will not update directly and all old waystones will not work

## How to install?
Simply place the zip file into the datapacks folder of any world you would like to have waystones and run ```/reload``` or reload the world, then enable the resourcepack.
